1. This project is a GUI application written in python which will record the speech of the user and converts the recorded audio into speech and saves it into a .txt file
2. Along with the text conversion, the application also detects the sentiments (either positive, negative or neutral) and mentions in the file.
3. The generated file is saved into the system and also it is uploaded to online cloud service (Google Drive used for this purpose) to keep track of the recordings.
